Rules:

- Do not read the whole vault.
- Do not directly modify vault Markdown files unless explicitly approved.

- Start from README.md, MOCs, project notes, playbooks and prompts.

- If a vault update is needed but cannot be done through CLI, write it to docs/ai/VAULT_UPDATE_PROPOSAL.md.
- Never store secrets, tokens, private keys, sensitive logs or raw dumps in the vault.
